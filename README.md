# Summary
Aircall is a mobile device implementation that:
- Displays a list of recent calls 
- Allows for archiving singular calls
- Allows for viewing all archived calls
- allows for unarchiving a call

## Time box
The 48-hour time box was used in this challenge. 

## Notes
Given more time, I would have included testing and more user functions like delete, etc

## Dependencies

Run NPM install to install all dependencies.

- React
